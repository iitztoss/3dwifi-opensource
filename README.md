The Geeetech 3dWiFi Open Source Firmware Project
-

Since Geeetech discontinued its 3DWiFi servers, the users who bought the product were left with a useless brick, given the hardware needs to be registered to their servers before you can connect it.

I'll publish every bit of information that I can find on this product, then I'll try to start off with something. (the only problem is that I don't know how to code...)
